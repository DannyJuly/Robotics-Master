We have collected a dataset of a person grasping various objects. For each object, 
the person has performed multiple grasps. For each grasp, we have recorded joint 
angles and forearm EMG data.
we will only look at joint angle data. Using Kmeans clustering, decide if the joint 
angles in this dataset cluster together, and if these clusters indeed correspond
to the various objects being grasped.
